# Catch Game

A small single-page browser game "Catch the Apples" designed for GitHub Pages. Use the left/right arrow keys or touch to move the basket and catch falling apples. Built quickly as a starting playable demo.

To view the game:
- Ensure the repository's Pages are served from the `main` branch (or open index.html locally).

Customizations you might want:
- Replace fruit graphics with images
- Add levels, sound effects, or mobile UI tweaks
- Tweak spawn rate, speeds, and scoring

Enjoy!
